Installation Instructions for DollVault 
1. To down load Xcode, one can search in App Store on a MacBook and download the latest version. If one is already there, update might be needed.
2. Once Xcode is open, one can choose “Open a project or file” and go the the folder named DollVault before choosing the file “DollVault.xcodeproj” to open the project.
3. SwiftUI has already been imported in the files and it’s embedded in so there’s no need to download or install it.
4. To run the project, the easier way is to use a simulator. One can simply click the app’s name on the top, a list of simulator options should show up. For demonstration I’ve chosen an iPhone 14 Pro but any iPhone simulator available would do.
5. One can simply click the play button or click “Run” under “Product”.
6. One does need to log on their Apple ID on the simulator device to run the app though. The
app’s Icon is visible on the Home Screen of the simulator also.
